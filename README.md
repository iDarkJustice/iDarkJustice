- 👋 Hi, Im @iDarkJustice
- 👀 Im interested in programming but I have suffered an attack and I dont have the resources to buy 
      a new laptop to be able to program, I ask my community to show solidarity and shake hands to support each other :(
- 🌱 Im currently learning python but I do it by cell phone since I do not have a laptop at the moment ...
- 💞️ Im looking to collaborate in the community like any programmer
- 📫 How to get to me ... you can help me by sending 1 dollar of which is not much for a person or 
      what your heart tells you but you will support me a lot by helping me https://paypal.me/Kearsecco
